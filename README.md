## Overview
### Description
This app allows you to input your closet items to help assist you with future shopping. It will have an easy to use search feature, so the user would always be aware of how much close of a certain category they have.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
* **Category:** Lifestyle
* **Mobile:** Can take pictures of clothes and tag them immediately. Also can be used on the go when shopping and comparing your closet with what you are planning to purchase.
* **Story:** Gives people a well rounded look at their closet and helps them not lose track of clothes that are out of season. 
* **Market:** There are other apps available like this, but I fell like being able to search through the closet will be an important aspect. Some times we put away our summer clothes for the winter and then forget about them, when summer comes around again we have forgoten about our summer clothes and go out an by a pair of flip flops not realizing that we already ahve two pairs stored away with our summer clothes.
* **Habit:** Will be used whenever a person is shopping or just wanting to look through the clothes that one has.
* **Scope:** The main aspects of this app would be adding items to your in app 'closet' and having ways to organize the items. After that, I think more interesting features could be added.
